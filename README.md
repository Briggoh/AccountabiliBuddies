# About Us

AccountabiliBuddies is an online space for individuals to semi-anonymously connect with others working towards a common goal. We strive to create a safe environment which encourages support and camaraderie amongst individuals seeking to eliminate harmful habits and/or hold themselves accountable to accomplish their goals. With initial sign up, the user is paired with a "Buddy", and the two are able to check in with one another and share their progress daily.
